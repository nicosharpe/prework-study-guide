# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.

My motivation for this course was wanting to switch careers from graphic design to web development.

I built this study guide to utilise and familiarise myself with coding techniques learned in class as well as showcase what I have learned so that I and anyone else just starting out in the coding world can use it as a reference.

In this prework I learned about HTML, CSS, git and Javascript and ways to implements them.
